# Molecular-fingerprints
This notebook was used to show how to generate molecular fingerprints  of molecules that includes MACCS-keys, Avalon, Atom-pair, 
Topological-Torsions, Morgan and RDKit fingerprints using RDKit. 
It also explains how to calculate Tanimoto coefficient and its application for compound search and its use in Taylor-Butina clustering.
